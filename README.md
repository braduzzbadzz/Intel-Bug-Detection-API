# Intel-Bug-Detection-API

This project aims to build a machine learning-powered API that detects bugs in code snippets and suggests corrections. It's designed to help developers, especially students and beginners, quickly identify and resolve common coding errors through an easy-to-use web interface or API endpoint.
